# RFP Agent AI

## Overview

RFP Agent AI is an AI-powered B2B enterprise application for automated Request for Proposal (RFP) processing and quote generation, specifically designed for the wires and cables manufacturing industry. The system uses a multi-agent architecture powered by **Google Gemini AI** to intelligently extract requirements from RFP documents, match specifications to a product catalog, and generate pricing estimates.

The application follows a three-agent workflow with AI-enhanced intelligence:
1. **Sales Agent** - Uses natural language understanding to extract and summarize RFP requirements (voltage, material, insulation, compliance standards)
2. **Technical Agent** - Intelligently matches RFP specifications to the SKU catalog with match percentages and provides reasoning for each match
3. **Pricing Agent** - Generates detailed cost estimates with smart quantity recommendations, including material, service, and testing costs, plus strategic pricing analysis

## Key Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Processing** - Leverages Google Gemini Pro for intelligent document understanding
- 📊 **Smart SKU Matching** - AI evaluates technical compatibility beyond simple keyword matching
- 💰 **Intelligent Pricing** - Context-aware quantity recommendations and pricing strategies
- 🔄 **Fallback Logic** - Graceful degradation to rule-based processing if AI is unavailable
- ⚡ **Fast Processing** - Typical RFP processing in 10-15 seconds
- 🎯 **High Accuracy** - AI reasoning provides transparency in matching and pricing decisions

## AI Integration

### LLM Provider
- **Model**: Google Gemini Pro (`gemini-pro`)
- **API**: Google Generative AI API (v1beta)
- **Cost**: Free tier (60 requests/min, 1,500 requests/day)
- **Capacity**: Process ~500 RFPs per day within free limits

### AI Agent Architecture

Each agent uses Gemini AI to process information intelligently:

#### Sales Agent (AI-Powered)
- Extracts structured data from unstructured RFP text
- Understands various date formats and terminology
- Identifies technical specifications even with non-standard phrasing
- Robust compliance standard detection
- Falls back to regex-based parsing if AI fails

#### Technical Agent (AI-Powered)
- Evaluates SKU compatibility using intelligent reasoning
- Considers voltage range compatibility and technical equivalence
- Provides detailed reasoning for each SKU match
- Calculates weighted match percentages (Voltage: 40%, Material: 30%, Insulation: 30%)
- Falls back to rule-based matching if AI fails

#### Pricing Agent (AI-Powered)
- Recommends optimal quantities based on project scope
- Analyzes voltage ratings to determine appropriate quantities
- Provides reasoning for quantity recommendations
- Generates strategic pricing analysis and recommendations
- Falls back to standard pricing formulas if AI fails

### Environment Configuration

Required environment variable:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling:
- API timeout handling (30 seconds per agent)
- Automatic fallback to rule-based logic
- Graceful degradation without service disruption
- Detailed error logging for debugging

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

```

### Data Flow
1. User inputs RFP text via the frontend
2. Frontend calls `/api/process-rfp` endpoint
3. Backend orchestrates the three AI agents sequentially:
   - Sales Agent → Gemini API → RFP Summary
   - Technical Agent → Gemini API → SKU Matches with reasoning
   - Pricing Agent → Gemini API → Cost estimates with analysis
4. Results (summary, SKU matches, pricing, AI reasoning) returned to frontend
5. Frontend displays results in cards, tables, and status indicators

### Validation
- Zod schemas for request/response validation
- Shared schema definitions between frontend and backend
- Type-safe API contracts
- AI response validation with fallback handling
